# NAOobjectRecognition
This is a script with a convolution neural network that allows the NAO Robot to classify a wide range of images. There will also be Python script dependencies added that allow this Script to communicate with the NAO Robot's camera and speech features. 
It is important that the 2.7 version of Python is used for running this script as libraries like NaoQi are only available in such a version.
